### I. Problem Statement
> Small retail businesses struggle with affording and utilizing sophisticated database management systems (DBMS). This hampers their ability to manage and leverage data, make informed business decisions, and compete with larger enterprises. Factors contributing to this challenge include limited financial resources, lack of technical expertise, inflexibility of traditional DBMS solutions, and the need for customized solutions for unique and changing business needs. Our project aims to develop a low-cost, high-performance database system tailored for retail businesses, focusing on streamlining operations, improving data accuracy, tracking product information, managing sales data, monitoring supplier performance, handling logistics, and tracking orders. This system will provide small retail businesses with a competitive edge, enabling efficient data storage, processing, and analysis.

### II. Why Do We Need a Database Instead of an Excel File?
> While Excel files are useful, they have significant limitations compared to databases. Databases ensure data integrity through primary keys (e.g., CustomerID, ProductID, OrderID) and structured data types (e.g., INT, VARCHAR, FLOAT), which Excel lacks. Databases handle real-time updates and large-scale data additions efficiently through indexing and SQL queries, offering better data retrieval and analysis capabilities. Additionally, databases support concurrent access and provide robust security against unauthorized access, unlike Excel’s single-user restriction.

### III. Target User
> Supply Chain Managers: Use the database to track products, manage inventory, and optimize supply chain operations.
> Sales and Marketing Teams: Analyze customer preferences, track sales performance, manage customer relationships, and identify market opportunities.
> Procurement Teams: Optimize supplier relationships, track purchases, and minimize costs.
> Logistics Coordinators: Coordinate shipments, track logistics, and optimize warehouse organization.
> Database Administrators: Maintain and monitor the database, ensuring security, performance, and recovery.

### IV. ER Diagram
> The ER diagram illustrates the entity relationships within the database, including customers, products, orders, locations, shipping, and transactions.

### V. Data Schema
> Customer’s Data: Details of customer’s name, segment.
> Department’s Data: Details of department names.
> Category’s Data: Represents product categories.
> Product’s Data: Details of product names, prices, status.
> Transaction’s Data: Type of transactions.
> Order’s Data: Details of orders, including date, time, status.
> OrderItems’s Data: Order item details, including quantity, price, discounts.
> Location’s Data: Customer and order location information.
> Shipping’s Data: Shipping details, including mode, date, time, delivery status.

### VI. Relationship Between Tables
> Location and Shipping: One-to-Many
> Location and Customers: Many-to-One
> Shipping and Orders: One-to-Many
> Orders and Transaction: One-to-One
> Orders and Order Items: One-to-Many
> Customers and Order Items: One-to-Many
> Product and Order Items: Many-to-One
> Products and Category: Many-to-One
> Products and Department: Many-to-One

### VII. Attributes
> Attributes for each table include primary keys, data types, and constraints to ensure data integrity and consistency.

### VIII. Approach Used to Create Tables from CSV
> Data was imported from a CSV file into a main table, from which relevant data was inserted into appropriate tables after data cleaning and feature engineering steps.

### IX. Performed Queries
> Sales Distribution Across Regions
> Total Revenue Generated by Each Category
> Average Shipping Days by Shipping Mode
> Customer Purchases and Product Details

### X. BCNF Proof
> Each table satisfies BCNF criteria, where every non-trivial functional dependency has its left-hand side as a superkey.

### XI. Use of Indexing
> Indexing improved query retrieval times, especially for grouping operations, ensuring efficient query execution on larger datasets.

### XII. Querying
> High-Value Customers: Customers with total order value exceeding a specified limit.
> Most Popular Product in Each Category
> Top 10 Highest-Selling Products
> Insert, Update, Delete Operations on Customer’s Table
> Products with Highest Profit Margins
> Most Profitable Products in Each Category

### XIII. Query Execution Analysis
> Analyzed execution costs for complex queries involving multiple joins and aggregations, and optimized performance through indexing.

> Administrators: Can modify the database (insert, update, delete records).
> End Users: Can view and analyze data without modifying the database.
